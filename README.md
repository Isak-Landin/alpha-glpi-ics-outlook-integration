# GLPI to Outlook Auto Importer

This PowerShell script automates the process of downloading a GLPI service desk `.ics` calendar file and importing its events directly into a named sub-calendar within Microsoft Outlook.

This Script is intended as a workaround. A workaround in two aspects, the first of which is if your organisation is using MS SSO or any other external auth-service that in turn does not allow you to use CalDav or WebCal to synchronize your glpi calendar to your Outlook calendar. The second part of the workaround is simply the fact that the issue can be resolved if you have admin or more specific permission in order to implement a smoother solution; such as creating a user utilizing glpi db username and password that can access your or many other's calendars. The second part would inherently result in Webcal or CalDav synchronization being possible.

### 2️⃣ Set Up the `data.psd1` Configuration File

1. Open the configuration file located at /path/to/github-repo/data.psd1:


2. Paste your copied ICS download link into the `IcsUrl` field:

```powershell
@{
    ExpectedCalendarName = 'AutoImport'
    IcsUrl = 'PASTE_YOUR_ICS_URL_HERE'
}
```

### 3️⃣ Set the Target Calendar Name

1. In the same configuration file (`data.psd1`), update the `ExpectedCalendarName` value to match the **exact name** of the Outlook calendar you want to import the events into.
- This `ExpectedCalendarName` is going to reference an Outlook calendar, **You can create the calendar later**, just remember the name.

   ```powershell
   @{
       ExpectedCalendarName = 'YourCalendarNameHere'
       IcsUrl = 'https://your-glpi-url...?token=...'
   }
   ```
